# Project Name
Guess who project.
Pretty selfexplainatory. What i loved about this project was that it made me use a lot of creative tools. 

## The problem
This time I went mobile first. That kind off slowed the project down as i was finishing it.
I watched a lot of tutorials on Traversy media and read a lot.
The logo: Adobe illustrator
The sounds: Logic pro X 
The images: bighead.io
